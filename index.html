<h1>Role of Technology in Learning</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Technology has become a very <strong>important</strong> part of education. 
    It helps students learn <em>faster</em>, <u>easier</u>, and in a 
    <i>more interesting</i> way.
    Today’s education is a smart blend of books and digital tools.<br>
    People call this <q>era of digital learning.</q>
</p>

<h3>Access to Information</h3>
<p>
    Students can search the 
    <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> 
    to gain knowledge from any corner of the world. Videos, articles, and apps 
    provide information anytime.
</p>

<h2>Interactive Learning</h2>
<p>
    Technology makes <b>learning fun</b>. For example, mathematical formulas like 
    <sup>E = mc²</sup> become easier through animations. In chemistry, we also use
